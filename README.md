<h1>Fluffy Giggle - Financial Analysis tool</h1>
A tool that helps us understand and manage our money.

The Financial Analysis Tool helps people see how well they are managing their money by comparing how much they planned to spend each month with how much they actually spend. It looks at different things to figure out if someone is doing well with their money or if they need to make some changes.

The things that can affect how much money someone has or how well they are doing financially.

Average monthly spending is the amount of money you usually spend in a month.

The tool helps us figure out how much money we usually spend each month. It does this by adding up all the amounts we spend each month and then dividing that total by the number of months we have data for.

The amount of money a person plans to spend each month.

People can tell the website how much money they want to spend each month by typing it into a box on the screen.

Comparison Rules are like rules that help us compare things. It's like when we have two things and we want to see which one is bigger, smaller, or the same. These rules help us figure that out. We can also use the symbol "<" which means "less than" to show that one thing is smaller than the other. Using the same example, we can say that 3 is less than 5 by using the "<" symbol. These symbols help us compare things and understand their relationships. When we compare things, we can use different symbols to show the relationship between them. For example, if we have two numbers and we want to see which one is bigger, we can use the symbol ">" which means "greater than". So if we have a number 5 and a number 3, we can say that 5 is greater than 3 by using the ">" symbol. Lastly, we can use the symbol "=" which means "equal to" to show that two things are the same. So if we have two numbers that are both 4, we can say that 4 is equal to 4 by using the "=" symbol.

The tool uses certain rules to sort out how well someone is doing with their money by comparing how much they earn and how much they spend each month.

If you have enough money left over after paying for things each month, you are in the "Gold (Financial Healthy)" category. If you have about the same amount of money left over as you spend each month, you are in the "Balanced" category. If you have less money left over and are starting to run out, you are in the "Almost Broke" category. And if you have very little money left over, you are in the "Broke" category.

These categories are made up and can be changed depending on the money rules or guidelines you want to use in your tool. They help to see if you are doing well with your money by comparing what you spend now to what you used to spend. You can change them to fit what you want to do with your money.

The Financial Analysis Tool is just for learning and not for making real money decisions. It's a good idea to talk to a money expert before you make any big decisions with your money.

The Financial Analysis Tool is like a tool that helps you understand money stuff, but it's not like a person who tells you what to do with your money. It's important to talk to someone who knows a lot about money before you make any big decisions.
